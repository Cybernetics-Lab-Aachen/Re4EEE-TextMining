which shortly thereafter would be one of the first blacks footballers member of the elite cr flamengo - but naive and inadequate preparation nekten the brazilian national team. the 8-4 lost friendly match against yugoslavia, played after the also unsuccessful world cup of 1934, made it painfully clear that brazil not only on his latin american opponents, but also by his opponents who were in the far east-europe tactical level significantly lagging behind. the biggest problem were the spaces between the lines: \u003cref group = note\u003ea \"line\" is in the football terminology tactical designation of a row of football players on a field. normally there is three lines: defense, midfield and attack; when one speaks of lines in a specific gaming system, they do this by setting the number of players per line of succession - for example, a \"5-3-2 system\" with five defenders, three midfielders and two strikers. when there is talk of \"too big spaces between the lines\", it usually refers to the utilization of certain lines, allowing the opponent to that part of the field is given too much space.\u003c/ref\u003e the yugoslavs the large pieces were unoccupied field use to easily perform their own tactics and regularly traversed without much difficulty the brazilian midfield and defense. the brazilian football community came the realization that it was necessary to slightly change the style of play.\n\n===brazil sees his shortcomings===\n\nalready at the end of the 30s tried the previously unknown brazilian gentil cardoso, who arrived with his work as a jack of all trades regularly in europe and there are free time devoted to watching football, to introduce a new tactical system . he had witnessed the emergence of the so-called stopperspil system with the english [[arsenal fc]] and saw this as the solution to the problem that was called brazilian football. in this system, playing the attackers in a \"w-formation\" and the midfielders and defenders \"m-formation\" (3-2-2-3) - in the tactical set-up for the final between brazil and uruguay in 1950 (see right) this is visible. the \"outside supporters\" or \"backs\" in the case of this arrangement bigode augusto, the wing players of the opposing catch; the \"inner defense\" or \"half-backs\", here danilo and bauer, face the back line of three defenders and ensure the collection of attackers who attempt over the middle of the field to break the defense; the stopperspil, to whom the system was named, and in this arrangement juvenal, stands between the two [[defender (association football)|outside defender]]s and is primarily intended to deal with the middle attacker or \"mid (s) for\" opponent. the cardoso managed to get a place as a coach at a small club from rio de janeiro. he led the system and trained it with the players, but saw that the game does not correspond to the british variant that he had seen. an arrangement was to take over, but copying the british style of play was not just possible. the attempt of cardoso failed.\n\nbrazil needed a european to come to a definite change in style of play. in the form of the hungarian [[izidor kürschner]] it was found. in 1937 the president of cr flamengo approached him and kürschner accepted the offer, though he realized the difficulty of his position as coach by the conservative attitude that now the brazilians had developed in the field of football after the british. cardoso had tried to introduce the british stopperspil system; kürschner, who had most of his football career spent in switzerland, did not share that ambition. the system was also he called \"a w-m\", but in reality it was more like a \"w-w ', the stopperspil now played before the rear defenders. popular hungarian was not his style, though he was well asked by the brazilian football association to travel to france with the national team in 1938 in the role of advisor. the system did not achieve success in the following years, with the [[1950 fifa world cup]] as low. strikingly, the brazilian team defeated opponents who used a similar system, but was lost to the different tactical uruguay. it was an unusual circumstance that the uruguayan players with the same defensive intent to play football as brazil had done herself on the won copa américa in 1919.\u003cref name = \"reference12\" /\u003e the failure of 1950 marked the final end of the brazilian stopperspil system . for years it had prevailed in the fields, but in 1966 it was both clubs disappeared from the national team out tactics.\n\nin the period between 1950 and 1966 brazil was despite vertwijfeldheid about his tactics have certainly been successful: both the world championship was won in 1958 as in 1962. they had understood that the brazilian football would do themselves short when tactic was chosen over technique. the result was that the coaches gave players a lot of freedom and tactical arrangement made as flexible as possible. the world's best players were in the 60s and 70s often from brazil. to the qualities of players like [[garrincha]] and [[valdir pereira]] optimal use, it was decided to form a tactic that offered enough space for the usual creativity and artistry which had characterized the latin american football. on the evening of the [[1970 fifa world cup final|final]] of the world championship in 1970, joao saldanha, head coach during the qualification process for this world cup, asked why he felt that the football the best football that was played in brazil in was world. he suggested that this would be the result of four factors.\n#allereerst climate would play an important role because in brazil the climate is such that it can be played soccer throughout the year;\n#ten second he suggested that poverty brazilian youth would be encouraged to achieve a competitive spirit;\n#de variation in [[ethnicity]] and had in brazilian society saldanha said a third factor for success, because a significant portion of the population ancestors of african descent and thus a past in slavery and inherited here a combative attitude would have;\n#ten fourth would be the \"boundless passion for the 'futebol' '' also have been vital in achieving success in the second half of the twentieth century.\u003cref name = \"reference06\"/\u003e\n\nbrazil experienced after the pivot stopper system just one typical football system, the so-called 4-2-2 -
