april\u0026nbsp;3, 1984 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying into a moderate tropical storm two days later. given the name kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by april\u0026nbsp;9. kamisy reached winds of 170\u0026nbsp;km/h (105\u0026nbsp;mph) before making landfall in extreme northern madagascar near [[antsiranana|diego suarez]]. it weakened upon entering the [[mozambique channel]], but briefly re-intensified on april\u0026nbsp;10. that day while passing near [[mayotte]], the cyclone turned to the southeast, striking madagascar again near [[majunga]]. kamisy quickly crossed the country. after emerging into the indian ocean off the east coast of madagascar, the system reintensified into a moderate tropical storm before dissipating on april\u0026nbsp;16.\n\nin northern madagascar, kamisy produced wind gusts of {{convert|250|km/h|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}, which destroyed 80% of the city of diego suarez. about 39,000\u0026nbsp;people were left homeless in the area, and there were five deaths. in western madagascar, the cyclone dropped {{convert|232.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall in 24\u0026nbsp;hours in majunga, which damaged rice fields in the region after causing widespread river flooding. additionally, the storm destroyed about 80% of majunga. throughout the country, kamisy caused $250\u0026nbsp;million in damage and 68\u0026nbsp;deaths, with 215\u0026nbsp;people injured and 100,000\u0026nbsp;left homeless. fifteen people were killed and 30 others were injured in [[mahajanga]]. following the storm, emergency food and medical supplies were rushed into the nation. in addition to the impact to madagascar, one death and severe damage was reported in the [[comoros islands]], where all of the banana crop was destroyed.\n\n==meteorological history==\n{{storm path|kamisy 1984 track.png}}\ncyclone kamisy originated from an area of [[convection]] that formed in early april. on april\u0026nbsp;3, the system
