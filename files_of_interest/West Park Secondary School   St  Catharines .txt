it was an integral part of the community serving the educational and recreational needs of all families west of twelve mile creek. the school site adjoins the powerview park, which, like the swimming pool, is under the parks and recreation commission. west park students made use of the swimming pool, football and soccer fields, tennis courts and baseball diamond. in 1999, the track and its in-field were brought up to national standards. the combined park-and-school complex occupies a site of 14.5 acres. athletics using these facilities complemented other athletic programs in rowing, basketball, volleyball, golf, badminton and more.\n\nthe program of the school led to both university and college post secondary pursuits. the communication technology lab and television arts studio provided students with the opportunity to bring together their artistic creativity and academic strengths.\n\nin june 2012, trustees voted to close west park despite arguments that it is one of the newer schools in the [[district school board of niagara]].  trustee dalton clark voted against the proposal to close the school stating that \"he could not support a recommendation to close west park, because of the facilities the board would lose.\u003cref\u003e[http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2012/06/12/trustees-vote-to-close-kernahan-park-west-park trustees vote to close kernahan park, west park] ''st. catharines standard'', retrieved july 17, 2013\u003c/ref\u003e\n\n==rowing==\nwest park had a strong rowing tradition throughout the school's history. in 1970, principal ron baum asked rudy weiler to head up coaching the rowing program.  the program grew rapidly and in 1971, west park won the points championship at the 26th canadian scholastic rowing championships (now [[canadian secondary school rowing association]] or sccra championships)  in 1972, west park won a school-record seven cssra titles. in 1976, the rowing program expanded again when girls rowing was introduced.  the girls rowing program was successful from the start and \"from 1977 to 1981, west park’s girls eight won five straight high school triple crown titles, with victories at the stotesbury cup and the canadian and u.s. high school championships.\"\u003cref name=\"final farewell\"\u003e[http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2013/05/31/west-park-rowings-final-farewell west park rowing's final farewell] ''st. catharines standard'', retrieved july 17, 2013\u003c/ref\u003e from its beginnings in 1970 well into the 80's, \"west park’s rowing program was a powerhouse, winning 12-13 cssra combined team titles and producing 43 athletes who represented canada internationally at the junior and senior level. west park athletes won four bronze, one silver and two golds at world and olympic competitions, including kevin neufeld, a 1984 olympic champion in the men's eight.\"\u003cref name=\"final farewell\"/\u003e\n\nwest park competed in the early bird, mother's day, welland and london regattas. the season culminated with the canadian secondary school championship (formerly schoolboy) a 3-day competition at the end of may with more than 2,500 athletes.  west park has won numerous medals, including 77 plaques from the canadian secondary school championship and 15 plaques from the stotesbury cup, philadelphia.  students have also been awarded scholarships to harvard and michigan state among others. west park was one of the best equipped teams with over $300,000 worth of equipment purchased with funds raised by west park rowing alumni.\n\n==references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==external links==\n* [http://www.dsbn.edu.on.ca/ district school board of niagara]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/pages/west-park-secondary-school/328534599356/ west park facebook page]\n\n[[category:high schools in niagara region]]\n[[category:education in st. catharines]]"}
