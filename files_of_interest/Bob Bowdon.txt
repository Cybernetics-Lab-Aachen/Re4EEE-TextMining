name=bowdon/\u003e the film views the current state of public schools in the u.s. as a “national disaster for the workforce of the future.” bowdon notes that the u.s., by many measures, “spends more on education than any country in the world,” and chooses to concentrate principally on his own state, [[new jersey]], which spends more per student on public education than any other state, but where average standardized-test scores in public schools are very low. in an effort to explain where all the money allocated to public education is going, bowdon portrays a union-dominated institutional culture in which bureaucracies are overstaffed by highly paid administrators, expenditures on school-construction projects are unsupervised and out of control, corruption and patronage are rampant, incompetent teachers cannot be fired, and excellent teachers cannot be rewarded. as a solution to the problem, bowdon proposes [[school choice]] and [[charter school]]s.\u003cref name=tube\u003e{{cite

frighteningly powerful, limiting parents' ability to make decisions about their children's schooling. he encouraged parents to attend school-board meetings and asked informed questions about such
