and artist/co-writer [[jack kirby]], the characters first appeared in [[uncanny x-men|''the x-men'']] #1 (september 1963). they are among the most recognizable and successful intellectual properties of marvel comics, appearing in numerous books, [[x-men in television|television shows]], [[x-men (film series)|films]], and [[list of x-men video games|video games]].\n\nthe x-men are [[mutant (marvel comics)|mutants]], a subspecies of humans who are born with superhuman abilities activated by the \"x gene\". the x-men fight for peace and equality between normal humans and mutants in a world where antimutant bigotry is fierce and widespread. they are led by charles xavier, also known as [[professor x]], a powerful mutant telepath who can control and read minds. their archenemy is [[magneto (comics)|magneto]], a powerful mutant with the ability to generate and control [[magnetic fields]]. both have opposing views and philosophies regarding the relationship between mutants and humans. while the former works towards peace and understanding between mutants and humans, the latter views humans as a threat and believes in taking an aggressive approach against them, though he has found himself working alongside the x-men from time to time.\n\nprofessor x is the founder of xavier's school for gifted youngsters at a location commonly called the [[x-mansion]], which recruits mutants from around the world. located in [[north salem, new york|salem center]] in [[westchester county, new york]], the x-mansion is the home and training site of the x-men. the founding five members of the x-men who appear in ''[[uncanny x-men|the x-men]]'' #1 (september 1963) are angel ([[warren worthington iii|archangel]]), [[beast (comics)|beast]], [[cyclops (marvel comics)|cyclops]], [[iceman (marvel comics)|iceman]], and marvel girl ([[jean grey]]); [[professor x]] and [[magneto (comics)|magneto]] also made their first appearances in ''[[uncanny x-men|the x-men]]'' #1. since then, dozens of mutants from various countries and diverse backgrounds have held membership as x-men.\n\n==background and creation==\nin 1963, with the success of [[spider-man]] in ''[[amazing fantasy]]'', as well

versus evil and later included storylines and themes about [[prejudice]] and [[racism]], all of which have persisted throughout the series in one form or another. the evil side in the fight was shown in human form and under some sympathetic beginnings via magneto, a character who was later revealed to have survived nazi concentration camps only to pursue a hatred for normal humanity. his key followers, quicksilver and the scarlet witch, were [[romani people|romani]]. only one new member of the x-men was added, [[mimic (comics)|mimic]]/calvin rankin,\u003cref\u003e''x-men'' (1st series)

introduced by roy thomas before adams began work on the comic) and lorna dane, later called [[polaris (comics)|polaris]] (created by [[arnold drake]] and [[jim steranko]]). however, these later

with the exception of cyclops, who remained. this team differed greatly from the original. unlike in the early issues of the original series, the new team was not made up of teenagers and they also had a more diverse background. each was from a different country with varying cultural and philosophical beliefs, and all were already well-versed in using their mutant powers, several being

[[sunfire (comics)|sunfire]] (from [[japan]]), and [[wolverine (character)|wolverine]] (from [[canada]]). wolverine eventually became the [[breakout character]] on the team and, in terms of comic

would die in the very next mission. filling in the vacancy, a revamped [[jean grey]] soon rejoined the x-men under her new persona of \"phoenix\". angel, beast, iceman, [[havok (comics)|havok]], and

mist|terrigen]] cloud that circulated the world that appeared to be toxic to them, placing the x-men at odds with the [[inhumans]]. the x-men also dealt with apocalypse resurfacing, and the truth of what happened between cyclops and the inhumans that led to his death. storm's team resided in [[limbo (marvel comics)|limbo]] and worked to bring mutants to safety away from the terrigen. magneto's team took on a more militant approach. beast worked alongside the inhumans to attempt to find a way to alter the state of the terrigen, but later discovered that it couldn't be altered and would have rendered earth toxic for mutants. this revelation caused the x-men to declare war against the inhumans.\n\nin 2017, the ''[[resurrxion]]'' lineup was launched with ''x-men: prime''. it introduced new titles; ''[[x-men blue]]'', ''[[x-men gold]]'', ''[[weapon x]]'', new volumes of ''[[astonishing x-men]]'' and ''[[generation x (comics)|generation x]]'' and new solo series for cable, jean grey, and

characters crossing over from [[ultimate marvel|earth-1610]] to the earth-616 universe. early 2018 saw the phoenix force returning to earth and mysteriously resurrecting the original jean grey. a new

plot-devices and motifs for their various story arcs over the years that have become commonplace within the x-men canon.\n\n===time travel===\nmany of the x-men's stories delve into [[time travel]] either in the sense of the team traveling through time on a mission, villains traveling through time to alter history, or certain characters traveling from the past or future in order to join the present team. story arcs and spin-offs that are notable for using this plot device include [[days of future past]], [[x-men: messiah complex|messiah complex]], [[all-new x-men]], [[messiah war]], and

her bond with the phoenix. though not as iconic as jean and the phoenix, many other x-men characters have died and come back to life on occasion. death and resurrection has become such a common occurrence in the x-books that the characters have mentioned on numerous occasions that they're not strangers to death or have made comments that death doesn't always have a lasting effect on them. [[x-necrosha]] is a particular story arc that sees [[selene (comics)|selene]] temporarily reanimate many of the x-men's dead allies and enemies in order for her to achieve godhood.\u003cref\u003e{{cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/selene_gallio_(earth-616)|title=gallio (earth-616)|publisher=}}\u003c/ref\u003e{{non-tertiary source needed|date=november 2017}}\n\n===fate===\nmany of the characters deal with the topic of fate. in particular, [[destiny (irene adler)|destiny's]] abilities of precognition have affected certain plot points in the x-men's history long after she was killed off due to both the x-men and their enemies constantly searching for her missing diaries that foretell certain futures. the topic of fate takes center stage yet again in a story arc called \"the extremists\" involving attacks against the [[morlocks (comics)|morlocks]] due to one of them seeing a dark future for their people.\u003cref\u003e''uncanny x-men'' vol. 1, #487-491\u003c/ref\u003e some characters believe they already know their own fates, such as apocalypse believing he is fated to rule the mutants or magneto believing he is fated to lead the mutants to rise up against humans. other characters such as jean, prestige, [[apocalypse (comics)#evan sabahnur|evan sabanur]], hope summers, and [[warren worthington iii]] have all been wary of their fates and have all taken measures to alter their futures.\n\n===space travel===\n[[spacefaring|space travel]] has been a common staple in the x-men books beginning with the phoenix and dark phoenix sagas. since then space has been involved in many stories involving the x-men's allies and occasional rivals the [[shi'ar]] along with stories involving the phoenix force. space has been the setting for many stories involving the likes of [[brood (comics)|the brood]], such as the story arc where the villainous species was first introduced.\u003cref\u003e''uncanny x-men'' vol. 1, #155-166\u003c/ref\u003e through space noteworthy characters like the [[starjammers]] and [[vulcan (marvel comics)|vulcan]] were introduced. space travel played a major role in [[joss whedon|joss whedon's]] run on [[astonishing x-men]] via the introduction of [[s.w.o.r.d.

most famously this is addressed in jean grey when she gains near omnipotence through the phoenix and [[professor xavier]] after he violently uses his powers against magneto, unintentionally creating onslaught. mystique's sanity wavers throughout the franchise as her constant transformations causes more and more of her mind to fracture.\u003cref\u003e''uncanny x-men'' vol. 1

maintain her sanity due to her more aggressive nature and new powers. the character deadpool is famous for his blatant lack of sanity. after magneto stripped wolverine of his metal bones, wolverine began to become increasingly feral throughout most of the mid to late 1990s x-men comics. the nature of rogue's powers affecting her sanity due to her retaining the memories of others has been a central plot device on many occasions, most famously retaining [[carol danvers|ms. marvel's]] psyche throughout most of the 1980s. most recently emma frost's sanity has become fractured ever since cyclops died in her arms, causing her to declare war against inhumans.\u003cref\u003e''death of x'' #1-4\u003c/ref\u003e other characters who have had issues with sanity include cyclops, sabretooth, [[magik (illyana rasputin)|magik]], [[quentin quire]], x-23, and prestige.\n\n===[[political warfare]]===\nin the marvel universe, mutant rights is one of the hot controversial political topics and is something that is addressed numerous times in the x-books as a plot device. while some politicians like [[valerie cooper]] have legitimately tried to help the x-men, most have made it their mission to discredit the x-men in order to eliminate mutants once and for all. senator [[robert kelly (comics)|robert kelly]] began his platform on a strong outspoken anti-mutant sentiment until he changed his mind after being rescued by mutants later on in his career. when sabretooth's human son [[graydon creed]] ran for office, the x-men sent in [[cannonball (comics)|cannonball]] and iceman to discreetly join his campaign team and find anything on his anti-mutant agenda. this continued until it boiled to a head when his assassination led to \"[[operation: zero tolerance]].\" some of the issues presented in the comics serve as allegory to modern issues in the real world, such as lydia nance suggesting mass mutant deportation.\u003cref\u003e''x-men gold''

marvel comics series. they often meet characters from other series, and the global nature of the mutant concept means the scale of stories can be highly varied. the x-men's enemies range from mutant thieves to galactic threats.\n\nhistorically, the x-men have been based in the [[x-mansion|xavier institute]], in the town of salem, located in [[westchester county, new york]], and are often portrayed as a family. the x-mansion is often depicted with three floors and two underground levels. to the outside world, it acted as a higher learning institute until the 2000s, when xavier was publicly exposed as a mutant at which point it became a known mutant [[boarding school]]. xavier funds a corporation aimed at reaching mutants worldwide, though it ceased to exist following the 2005 \"decimation\" storyline. the x-men benefit from advanced technology such as xavier tracking down mutants with a device called [[cerebro]] which amplifies his powers; the x-men train within the [[danger room]], first depicted as a room full of weapons and booby traps, now as generating holographic simulations; and the x-men travel in their [[blackbird (comics)|blackbird

introduced several fictional locations which are regarded as important within the shared universe in which marvel comics characters exist:\n\n* [[asteroid m]], an asteroid made by magneto, a mutant utopia and training facility off of the earth's surface.\n* avalon, magneto's [[space station]] that served as the primary base for him and his acolytes to create a mutants-only safe haven after magneto drastically reverted to his villainous ways.\n* [[genosha]], an island near madagascar and a longtime [[crime of apartheid|apartheid]] regime against mutants. the u.n. gave control to magneto until the ''e is for extinction'' story saw genosha destroyed via mass [[genocide]].\n* [[limbo (marvel comics)|limbo]], a hellish dimension heavily populated by demons. whoever possesses the soulsword bears control over and can draw power from limbo. in [[extraordinary x-men]] the x-men made limbo their home after terrigen started making earth uninhabitable for mutants.\n* [[madripoor]], an island in [[south east asia]], near singapore. its location is shown to be in the southern portion of the [[strait of malacca]], south west of singapore.\n* mojoverse, an alternate dimension ruled by the tyrant [[mojo (comics)|mojo]] focused on creating violent [[reality television|reality entertainment]] usually featuring captive mutants\n* [[murderworld (comics)|murderworld]], fictional twisted amusement park designed by the marvel supervillain known as arcade.\n* [[muir island]], a remote island off the coast of [[scotland]]. this is primarily known in the x-men universe as the home of [[moira mactaggert]]'s laboratory.\n* [[mutant town]] (also known as district x), an area in [[alphabet city, manhattan]], populated largely by mutants and beset by poverty and crime.\n* new tien, a mutant-ran region in the united states west coast where mutants are the majority over humans that was created after [[secret empire (comics)|hydra took over the states]]. emma frost secretly leads new tien via telepathically possessing xorn as new tien's [[puppet ruler]].\n* [[savage land]], a preserved location in [[antarctica]] which is home to a number of extinct species, most notably [[dinosaur]]s, and strange tribes.\n* [[shi'ar|shi'ar throneworld chandilar]], the home world of the x-men's occasional [[wikt:extraterrestrial|extra-terrestrial]] allies the shi'ar.\n* [[asteroid

nation.\n\n==other versions==\n* \"[[age of apocalypse]]\" – in a world where professor x is killed before he can form the x-men, magneto leads the x-men in a dystopian world ruled by apocalypse. created and reverted via time travel.\n* \"[[days of future past]]\" – [[sentinel (comics)|sentinels]] have either killed or placed into concentration camps almost all mutants. prevented by the time-traveling kate pryde (the adult kitty pryde/shadowcat).\n* \"[[house of m]]\" – reality is altered by [[scarlet witch]], with her father magneto as the world's ruler. 2005's crossover event, it concludes with a reversion to the normal marvel universe, albeit with most mutants [[decimation (comics)|depowered]].\n* [[marvel 1602]] – mutants are known as the \"witchbreed\" in this alternate reality set during the time of [[inquisition|the inquisition]]. carlos javier creates a \"school for the children of gentlefolk\" to serve as a safe haven and training ground.\n* [[marvel 2099]] – set in a dystopian world with new characters looking to the original x-men as history, becoming [[x-men 2099]] and [[x-nation 2099]].\n* ''[[mutant x (comics)|mutant x]]'' – set in a world where scott summers was captured along with his parents by the shi'ar and only alex escaped, allowing him to be the eventual leader of this universe's x-men (\"the six\"). the mutant x universe reimagines

served as a metaphor for acceptance of all people for their special and unique gifts. the mutant condition that is often kept secret from the world can be analogous to feelings of difference and fear usually developed in everyone during adolescence.{{citation needed|date=september 2013}}\n* '''[[genocide]]:''' genocide and its psychological after-affects, primarily [[survivor guilt]], are
