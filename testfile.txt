{"Error":"","Title":"Consilience","ArticleID":"7638","Text":"{{other uses}}\n\nIn [[science]] and [[history]], '''consilience''' (also '''convergence of evidence''' or '''concordance of evidence''') refers to the principle that [[evidence]] from independent, unrelated sources can \"converge\" on strong conclusions. That is, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be very strong even when none of the individual sources of evidence is significantly so on its own. Most established scientific knowledge is supported by a convergence of evidence: if not, the evidence is comparatively weak, and there will not likely be a strong [[scientific consensus]].\n\nThe principle is based on the [[unity of knowledge]]; measuring the same result by several different methods should lead to the same answer. For example, it should not matter whether one measures the distance between the [[Giza pyramid complex]] by [[Laser rangefinder|laser rangefinding]], by [[satellite imaging]], or with a [[meter stick]] – in all three cases, the answer should be approximately the same. For the same reason, different dating methods in [[geochronology]] should concur, a result in [[chemistry]] should not contradict a result in [[geology]], etc.\n\nThe word ''consilience'' was originally coined as the phrase \"consilience of inductions\" by [[William Whewell]] (\"consilience\" refers to a \"jumping together\" of knowledge).\u003cref name=\"Wilson\"\u003e{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O|title= Consilience: the unity of knowledge|year=1998|publisher=[[Alfred A.

Accessed: 17 October 2015.\u003c/ref\u003e\n\n==Description==\n\nConsilience requires the use of independent methods of measurement, meaning that the methods have few shared characteristics. That is, the mechanism by which the measurement is made is different; each method is dependent on an unrelated natural phenomenon. For example, the accuracy of laser rangefinding measurements is based on the scientific understanding of [[laser]]s, while satellite pictures and meter sticks rely on different phenomena. Because the methods are independent, when one of several methods is in error, it is very unlikely to be in error in the ''same way'' as any of the other methods, and a difference between the measurements will be observed.\u003cref group=note\u003eNote that this is not the same as performing the same measurement several times. While repetition does provide evidence because it shows that the measurement is being performed consistently, it would not be consilience and would be more vulnerable to error.\u003c/ref\u003e If the scientific understanding of the properties of lasers were inaccurate, then the laser measurement would be inaccurate but the others would not.\n\nAs a result, when several different methods agree, this is strong evidence that ''none'' of the methods are in error and the conclusion is correct. This is because of a greatly reduced likelihood of errors: for a consensus estimate from multiple measurements to be wrong, the errors would have to be similar for all samples and all methods of measurement, which is extremely unlikely. [[Random errors]] will tend to cancel out as more measurements are made, due to [[regression to the mean]]; [[systematic errors]] will be detected by differences between the measurements (and will also tend to cancel out since the direction of the error will still be random). This is how [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] reach high confidence – over time, they build up a large degree of evidence which converges on the same conclusion.\u003cref group=note\u003eStatistically, if three different tests are each 90% reliable when they give a positive result, a positive result from all three tests would be 99.9% reliable; five such tests would be 99.999% reliable, and so forth. This requires the tests to be [[statistically independent]], analogous to the requirement for independence in the methods of measurement.\u003c/ref\u003e\n\nWhen results from different strong methods do appear to conflict, this is treated as a serious problem to be reconciled. For example, in the 19th century, the [[Sun]] appeared to be no more than 20 million years old, but the Earth appeared to be no less than 300 million years (resolved by the discovery of [[nuclear fusion]] and [[radioactivity]], and the theory of [[quantum mechanics]]);\u003cref\u003e[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/fusion/#1 John N. Bahcall, nobelprize.org]\u003c/ref\u003e or current attempts to resolve theoretical differences between quantum mechanics and [[general relativity]].\u003cref name=Weinberg\u003e\n{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first= S|year=1993|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|publisher=Vintage Books, New York}}\u003c/ref\u003e\n\n==Significance==\n\nBecause of consilience, the strength of evidence for any particular conclusion is related to how many independent methods are supporting the conclusion, as well as how different these methods are. Those techniques with the fewest (or no) shared characteristics provide the strongest consilience and result in the strongest conclusions. This also means that confidence is usually strongest when considering evidence from different fields, because the techniques are usually very different.\n\nFor example, the theory of [[evolution]] is supported by a convergence of evidence from [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[paleontology]], [[geology]], [[biogeography]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[comparative physiology]], and many other fields.\u003cref name=\"SciAm\"\u003e''Scientific American'', March 2005. \"The Fossil Fallacy.\" [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-fossil-fallacy Link.]\u003c/ref\u003e In fact, the evidence within each of these fields is itself a convergence providing evidence for the theory. (As a result, to disprove evolution, most or all of these independent lines of evidence would have to be found to be in error.\u003cref name=\"Shermer\" /\u003e) The strength of the evidence, considered together as a whole, results in the strong scientific consensus that the theory is correct.\u003cref name=\"SciAm\"/\u003e In a similar way, evidence about the [[history of the universe]] is drawn from astronomy, astrophysics, planetary geology, and physics.\u003cref name=\"Shermer\" /\u003e\n\nFinding similar conclusions from multiple independent methods is also evidence for the reliability of the methods themselves, because consilience eliminates the possibility of all potential errors that do not affect all the methods equally. This is also used for the validation of new techniques through comparison with the consilient ones. If only partial consilience is observed, this allows for the detection of errors in methodology; any weaknesses in one technique can be compensated for by the strengths of the others. Alternatively, if using more than one or two techniques for every experiment is infeasible, some of the benefits of consilience may still be obtained if it is well-established that these techniques usually give the same result.\n\nConsilience is important across all of science, including the social sciences,\u003cref\u003eFor example, in linguistics: see ''Converging Evidence: Methodological and theoretical issues for linguistic research, edited by Doris Schonefeld.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nGKT-2VwO0UC\u0026pg=PT92\u0026dq=Converging+Evidence\u0026hl=en\u0026sa=X\u0026ei=ipfuT_jrOIjpqAHnrp2OAg\u0026ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage\u0026q=Converging%20Evidence\u0026f=false Link.]\u003c/ref\u003e and is often used as an argument for [[scientific realism]] by philosophers of science. Each branch of science studies a subset of reality that depends on factors studied in other branches. [[Atomic physics]] underlies the workings of [[chemistry]], which studies [[emergence|emergent]] properties that in turn are the basis of [[biology]]. [[Psychology]] is not separate from the study of properties emergent from the interaction of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s. [[Sociology]], [[economics]], and [[anthropology]] are each, in turn, studies of properties emergent from the interaction of countless individual humans. The concept that all the different areas of research are studying one real, existing universe is an apparent explanation of why scientific knowledge determined in one field of inquiry has often helped in understanding other fields.\n\n==Deviations==\n\nConsilience does not forbid deviations: in fact, since not all experiments are perfect, some deviations from established knowledge are expected. However, when the convergence is strong enough, then new evidence inconsistent with the previous conclusion is not usually enough to outweigh that convergence. Without an equally strong convergence on the new result, the weight of evidence will still favor the established result. This means that the new evidence is most likely to be wrong.\n\nScience [[denialism]] (for example, [[HIV/AIDS denialism|AIDS denialism]]) is often based on a misunderstanding of this property of consilience. A denier may promote small gaps not yet accounted for by the consilient evidence, or small amounts of evidence contradicting a conclusion without accounting for the pre-existing strength resulting from consilience. More generally, to insist that all evidence converge precisely with no deviations would be naïve falsificationism,\u003cref name=\"Lakatos\"\u003eFor example, see [http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Lakatos-Falsification.pdf Imre Lakatos.], in ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'' (1970).\u003c/ref\u003e equivalent to considering a single contrary result to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] a theory when another explanation, such as equipment malfunction or misinterpretation of results, is much more likely.\u003cref name=\"Lakatos\"/\u003e\u003cref group=note\u003eMore generally, anything which results in a false positive or false negative.\u003c/ref\u003e\n\n==In history==\n\nHistorical evidence also converges in an analogous way. For example: if five ancient historians, none of whom knew each other, all claim that [[Julius Caesar]] seized power in Rome in 49 BCE, this is strong evidence in favor of that event occurring even if each individual historian is only partially reliable. By contrast, if the same historian had made the same claim five times in five different places (and no other types of evidence were available), the claim is much weaker because it originates from a single source. The evidence from the ancient historians could also converge with evidence from other fields, such as archaeology: for example, evidence that many senators fled Rome at the time, that the battles of [[Caesar’s civil war]] occurred, and so forth.\n\nConsilience has also been discussed in reference to [[Holocaust denial]]. \n{{quote|\"We [have now discussed] eighteen proofs all converging on one conclusion...the deniers shift the burden of proof to historians by demanding that ''each'' piece of evidence, independently and without corroboration between them, prove the Holocaust. Yet no historian has ever claimed that one piece of evidence proves the Holocaust. We must examine the collective whole.\"\u003cref name=\"Shermer\" /\u003e}}\n\nThat is, individually the evidence may underdetermine the conclusion, but together they overdetermine it. A similar way to state this is that to ask for one ''particular'' piece of evidence in favor of a conclusion is a flawed question.\u003cref name=\"SciAm\"/\u003e\u003cref name=\"Shermer2\"\u003e{{cite book|first=Michael|last= Shermer|year=2002|title=In Darwin’s Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace|page=319|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSSkPqmbeXIC}}\u003c/ref\u003e\n\n==Outside the sciences==\n\nIn addition to the sciences, consilience can be important to [[the arts]], [[ethics]] and [[religion]]. Both artists and scientists have identified the importance of biology in the process of artistic innovation.\u003cref name=Wilson /\u003e\n\n==History of the concept==\nConsilience has its roots in the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek concept]] of an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] orderliness that governs our [[cosmos]], inherently comprehensible by logical process, a vision at odds with [[mystical]] views in many cultures that surrounded the Hellenes. The [[Rationality|rational]] view was recovered during the high [[Middle Ages]], separated from [[theology]] during the [[Renaissance]] and found its apogee in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\u003cref name=\"Wilson\" /\u003e\n\nWhewell’s definition was that:\u003cref name=\"Whewell\"\u003e{{cite book|first=William|last= Whewell|year=1840|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon Their History|publisher=London: John W.

Wilson==\nAlthough the concept of consilience in Whewell's sense was widely discussed by philosophers of science, the term was unfamiliar to the broader public until the end of the 20th century, when it was revived in ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]],'' a 1998 book by the humanist biologist [[Edward Osborne Wilson]], as an attempt to bridge the culture gap between the sciences and the humanities that was the subject of [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures|The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'' (1959).\u003cref name=\"Wilson\" /\u003e\n\nWilson held that with the rise of the [[modern science]]s, the sense of unity gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. He asserted that the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give a purpose to understanding the details, to lend to all inquirers \"a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws.\" Wilson's concept is a much broader notion of consilience than that of Whewell, who was merely pointing out that generalizations invented to account for one set of phenomena often account for others as well.\u003cref name=\"Wilson\" /\u003e\n\nA parallel view lies in the term [[universology]], which literally means \"the science of the universe.\" Universology was first promoted for the study of the interconnecting principles and truths of all domains of knowledge by [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a 19th-century utopian futurist and anarchist.\u003cref name=\"Wilson\" /\u003e\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Appeal to authority]]\n* [[Appeal to tradition]]\n* [[Philosophy of science#Coherentism]]\n* [[Equifinality]]\n* [[Scientific method]]\n* [[Syncretism]]\n* [[Tree of Knowledge System]]\n* [[Unified Science]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|consilience}}\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/bookauth/ba980318.htm A conversation with Edward O.
