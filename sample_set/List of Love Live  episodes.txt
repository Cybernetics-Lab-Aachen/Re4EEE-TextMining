her first year fell apart, as she didn't want to destroy their vision of her. upon hearing about this, the girls arrange for nico to give a special performance for her siblings, claiming it to be her last performance as a 'solo idol' before joining her fellow idols as equals in μ's. \n}}\n{{japanese episode list\n |episodenumber   = 05\n |kanjititle      = 新しいわたし\n |romajititle     = atarashī
